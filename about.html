                <p>
                    Hello! I'm Shravani Adhav, passionate third-year engineering student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in 
                    Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I have a strong interest in understanding how software, 
                    data, and intelligent systems come together to solve practical problems. This curiosity drives me 
                    to continuously learn, experiment, and improve my approach to building meaningful digital solutions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I enjoy working as a Full Stack Developer, with hands-on experience in tools and technologies like 
                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB.I actively 
                    explore frameworks and architectural patterns that help me build applications that are functional,
                    scalable, and user-friendly. Whether I'm designing intuitive interfaces, structuring backend logic, 
                    or organizing workflows, I focus on bringing clarity, simplicity, and purpose to everything I create.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Along with development, I'm constantly strengthening my core fundamentals in C, C++, Python, 
                    Data Structures & Algorithms, OOP, Computer Networks, and Operating Systems. This technical 
                    foundation helps me approach problems logically and develop solutions that are both efficient and 
                    maintainable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Beyond coding, I value clarity in communication, clean documentation, and a calm, organized work style. 
                    I enjoy collaborating, learning from others, and contributing to projects where ideas turn into real 
                    impact. Every step in my journey-whether through academics or personal projects—helps me grow into a 
                    more confident developer and curious learner.
                </p>

               <p>
                Looking ahead, I aspire to develop my skills, work on impactful real-world projects, and contribute 
                to creating innovative, technology-driven solution.
               </p>
